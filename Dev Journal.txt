		>> ArkvedSpit1 spoke of the Reference Editor rotation fields, wanting these to only show positive numbers (something I've been meaning to request for years now). You replied saying you've fixed this, however I am still seeing negative numbers, and if I rotate in the render window itself and then open the Reference Editor window, the object can end up with negative rotation values even if they were positive before I touched the object. I have no idea what he/she is talking about when comparing to the vanilla Reference Editor window, it always showed negative numbers, and I cannot tell what buttons were requested to be restored.
		>> I agree that it would be nice to have restored the cut/copy/paste context menu options in the filter boxes without needing to use the keyboard.
		>> I'm sure someone must have requested this previously, but is there any way you can make the Render window display ALL 9 land textures in a single quad? The CS(E) only ever displays the first 8 textures, and then uses the land record's default texture in place of the 9th texture, though in-game all 9 are visible.
		>> Also, is that land texture quad window another fixed-size window, or can it be made a little bigger so none of the quad boxes require any scrolling?
		>> The lines in the land texture quad window don't correctly update themselves - if you add a new texture in the render window when the quad window is open, you then have to click on the line in the quad window which that texture would appear in to change it from a blank line to being populated with the new texture data.
		>> The Landscape Editing window lacks a visual marker to show when Vertex Shading is active. What would be really sensible (partly because I sometimes forget that the keyboard shortcut is Q so waste time pressing various keys and attempting to vertex paint before finding which key worked) would be a clickable toggle button to enable/disable Vertex Shading, which shows differently depending on whether active or not.

	BUGFIX			=
		> Render window OSD
			> The first right click inside the OSD after opening the context menu is ignored.
		> Check if the Launch Game button works correctly with the Steam version of the game
			> We probably need to use the loader
		> CSE INI preferences UI bug - exit confirmation message box is not showing up correctly/gets hidden under another window
		> CrashRpt doesn't handle any bounds-checked CRT funtion failures
			> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/set_constraint_handler_s
		> Selection mask does not work under certain lighting circumstances
			> Enhanced Econonmy.esp, EECell
		> Cell use list is broken
			> Forms instantiated with our custom serializers don't correctly update the cell count leading to negative values
			> Deleting a ref from the render window doesn't update its baseform's cell use counts (vanilla bug)

		> Dirty edits?

			>> How do you stop the construction set from making automatic edits to an esp after saving it? Like for the unofficial oblivion patch, if I were to open in up in the CSE, do nothing, and save it, it will make loads of changes to region point list data under the region tab in TES4EDIT. For another file it automatically changes the "vertext height map" data under worldspaces for a bunch of landscapes.
			>> Can you reproduce this consistently? This is the first I've heard about this.
			>> Yes, I can. Not sure if I have something installed incorrectly or what but it'll happen everytime. Here's a gallery with some before/after screens after saving the unofficial oblivion patch and ooo shivering isles in the CSE and doing nothing else:
			   Also for other esps, I see under cell/lighting that Fog Near will be changed from 0.000000 to 0.000100. I think that one is done to prevent some kind of bug though?
			   Edit: did the same with ooo's esp and the unofficial shivering isles patch
			   For the vertext height map, it will always change the last 3 sets of values and nothing else from what i can see. no idea if that's important but i thought i'd mention it

		> Object window columns like Auto calc, Enchantment type, Count don't sort consistently
			>> Columns not handled by default = 3, 24, 41, 54. Some others are incorrectly handled


	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Object Prefab nested Folders? just like the Object Window. 
		> Speed up the Export Dialogue tool
			> Also add progress counter
		> Could you modify the X and Y coordinate boxes in the Cell View so that hitting the tab key will move the cursor to the Y box? Type in an X coordinate, hit tab, then enter a Y coordinate. 
		> Option to disable loading all BSA archives (or just loading the ones used by the current loaded plugins)
		> In the creature creation window, when you tick the box to make the creature leveled (PC level offset), the numbers in the creature stats tab don't change. Which means that your creature is suddenly becoming incredibly overpowered as the numbers are now interpreted as multipliers. Would it be possible to make it so that ticking that box would also recalculate the numbers, please?
		> Paste-in-place for Global paste
			> No, it just pastes them a certain distance in front of the camera, as a standard copy/paste would do. You actually wouldn't want it to do a global paste in place most of the time, it's something which needs to happen only when specified, as with the local paste in place.
		> Render window shortcut to toggle rotation/scaling in world/modelspace.
			> Add an indicator to the OSD's info overlay
		> Gizmos
			> https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo/issues/154
		> A visibility toggle to display region borders in the Render window, so that you know exactly what is within and what is without a particular region.
		> Reimplement the hide active/deleted forms tool
		> An option to hide markers for thing such as Character placements on furniture as well as markers for effect like fire flies
		
		> Add support for TOD/sunlight lighting in exteriors
			> Currently only works with interiors that behave like exteriors
				>> Seems likely that the issue is dependent on modifying the fragment shaders used for lighting in exteriors

		> Double click on formIds/editorIds in the console
		> Wildcard find/replace
		> Add an option to restore a saved backup for some esp/esm, instead of manually recover it from Data/Backup folder and moving it back to Data folder.

		> Resizing dialogs
			> Global font for all windows
			> Individual dialogs can be zoomed in and out
			> Algo:
				- Enumerate all child windows
				- Get their rects and save in a tree for hierarchy
				- Pass 1: Visit each node and calculate the new rect based on the new font size
				- Pass 2: Visit each node and ensure that:
					- It doesn't clip with any siblings
						+ If it does, move the sibling until it doesn't (with some padding)
					- It's large enough to contain its children
				- We update the rects bottom-up and then resize and move the windows
